            <br><h2>How to Keep Your Cat from Getting Bored with Their Toys</h2>
           <h5>It's no secret that cats quickly lose interest in their toys. But there are a few things you can do to keep things fresh and exciting.</h5>
			<ol>
				<li>Put about half of your cat's toys away. Once a week put away 20% of the toys you left out and replace them with toys you previously put away. Your cat always feels like they have something new to play with.</li>
				<li>Try rubbing toys with catnip or silvervine powder to make them more enticing.</li>
				<li>Put electronic toys away when your cat isn't actively playing with them. Cats seem to lose interest in these quickly if they're left out all the time.</li>
				<li>Find new and different ways to play with your cat. Wand toys don't always have to fly in the air. They can slither on the ground, climb walls, or even hide and wiggle around to make noise. Furry mice are fun to throw. But you can also hide them along with a treat for hide-and-seek or drop them in a box with holes cut in it, so your cat can practice hunting ground critters. Be creative with play and switch things up often.</li>
			  </ol>

			  <p>Toys are such an important part of cat life, whether they're playing on their own or you're having a play session together. Your cat is getting tons of enrichment and giving you just as much joy. Make playtime a priority. It's worth it!</p>
