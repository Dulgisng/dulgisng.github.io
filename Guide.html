            <br><h5>Take your cat through their natural prey sequence.</h5>
            <ol>
                <!-- Displayed a numbered list -->
                <li><p>First cats stare at their prey.</p><br><img src="https://media1.giphy.com/media/fsu57DW244IyGgikk6/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e470gtnefnsyattytjrpju7wel55cynws0z3j3mdjou&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g"  width="380" height="320" alt="pic" class="center"></li>
                <li><p>Then they stalk and chase their prey.</p><br><img src="https://media3.giphy.com/media/tyttpGQ4gWCKZP6KMqA/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47qwv3l11omfc03e238svf8spb4un72hspfupwepol&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g"  width="380" height="320" alt="pic" class="center"></li>
                <li><p>At the perfect moment, they pounce or grab that prey.</p><br><img src="https://media2.giphy.com/media/e4BoeNGwaTvYk/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e473oez8g5w4okyc1f5qklj7xm62p1bsuy8shb4w3h3&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g"  width="380" height="320" alt="pic" class="center"></li>
                <li><p>And finally, they perform a kill-bite by taking it in their mouth and giving it a good shake or wrapping their front legs around it and bunny kicking with the back legs.</p><br><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0249/6472/6880/files/Untitled2_480x480.gif?v=1607075844"  width="380" height="320" alt="pic" class="center"></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Use the wand toy to take them through these different steps. And remember, they'll go back and forth, staring for a while, then attacking, then staring again, and so on.If they stop chasing the toy and just sit there watching it, that doesn't mean they're done. They've just reset to the staring phase. So, keep playing!</p>
            <br><h2>Top Recommendations of Cat Toys to Take Cats Through Prey Sequence</h2>
            <br><p>Look for an option that has a long, thin string so you can get a lot of movement from it. It's also helpful to have a clasp on the end. This lets you try different lures to see what your cat likes and you can keep things fresh by switching lures in and out every few days. Da Bird is my absolute favorite.</p>

            <u><h4>Warning: Never allow cats to play with 'string-type' items unsupervised. This includes balls of yarn, rubber bands, etc.</h4></u>
            <p>The end of a string can become stuck somewhere along the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (tongue, teeth, in the stomach, or in the intestines). The other end of the string progresses down the GI tract. As the intestines attempt to move the free end further down the tract, they become bunched up (like an accordion). This can result in intestinal death as well as intestinal perforation and peritonitis, which is life-threatening. Surgery is often required.Put Da Bird and other string toys away when you're not actively playing with and supervising your cat.</p>
                <p>Here is a video of Preventive Vet cat, Mazel, playing with Da Bird in his cat tree. Also, enjoy his fuzzy belly towards the end of the video.</p>

                  <br><h2>Toys for Cats Who Likes to Chew</h2>
                  <p>If your cat is a big chewer, it's important to take a look at their lifestyle. Could this be a self-soothing behavior due to stress? Are they bored? Are they getting hungry between meals? Most importantly, are they actually ingesting what they're chewing? If your cat seems obsessed with chewing or is swallowing what they chew, it's a good idea to talk with your veterinarian and a feline behavior consultant. Sometimes a few changes to their environment and giving them ways to decrease stress can reduce chewing. Giving them acceptable options for chewing can also be helpful.</p>

                  <p>Chewy, meaty treats like <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=Sheba+Treats+Meaty+Tender+Sticks+Soft+Cat+Treats+Chicken+Flavor%2C+%285+Treats%29+0.14+oz.+Sticks+%28Pack+of+10%29&linkCode=gg3&linkId=8136c149be65776aef9a4a101b1123d4&tag=reventet-20">Sheba Meaty Tender Sticks</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B007IGMZD4?ref_=as_li_ss_tl&language=en_US&linkCode=gg4&linkId=4995fe34d5dcfa1fb2573c0e33083d27&tag=reventet-20&th=1">Natural True Chews</a> can give your cat a similar sensation as chewing things they shouldn't.</p>
                <p>There are cat toys specifically made for cats to chew. Whether your cat will actually use them that way or not depends on the cat.</p>
                <u><h4>Warning: Monitor cats closely when playing with these or any toys. If whole pieces are swallowed, they can be a choking hazard.</h4></u>

                <br><h5>Things made for chewing that may not be safe for cats</h5>
                <p>Be cautious. Just because a product says cats can chew it doesn't mean they should. This is especially true if your cat ingests what they chew.</p>
                <p>
                    Silvervine sticks are marketed as a chew option for cats. If you're not familiar with it, silvervine has an effect similar to catnip but it's usually more intense. It's often sold in powder form. These sticks, however, are just that â€¦ sticks, usually with the bark on.</p>
                <p>A cat who really chews could easily pull off pieces of the bark and stick. And these large splinters could get stuck in the soft pallet, wedged between the teeth, or worse yet, swallowed where they could pierce the stomach or intestines. I tried these once for my chewer and immediately realized it was way too risky.</p>
                <p>If your cat enjoys silvervine, stick to the powder form and sprinkle it on a safer chew toy instead.</p>
                <p>Dog chew toys are made for chewing. Can you use them for your cat? There's no blanket answer. You have to look at the toy itself.</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>It should be small enough that it will fit in your cat's mouth without getting wedged in the jaw. Most dogs, even toy breeds, have larger mouths than the average cat.</li>
                    <li>It should not be made of hard plastic. Cat teeth aren't as durable as a dog's. Furthermore, cats can have undiagnosed tooth resorption, which makes them fragile and they can break at the gum line.</li>
                    <li>Make sure it doesn't have any cords, fringe, or other soft pieces a cat could chew through.</li>
                  </ol>

                  <br><h5>Cat Toy Safety Tips</h5>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Chew toys should only be given to your cat while supervised.</li>
                    <li>Check toys regularly for signs of wear and tear. Get rid of toys as soon as they start to unravel or pieces come loose that your cat could swallow. This includes plastic eyes or ears, tails on furry mice, etc.</li>
                    <li>Never give your cat bones to chew.</li>
                    <li>Cotton swabs aren't technically made for cats to chew, but it happens quite often, and that can be dangerous.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <br><h2>Are Laser Toys OK for Cats?</h2>
                    <p>You may have heard about this debate. It's thought by some that playing with a laser toy can actually be extremely stressful for cats. Go back to the prey sequence. The laser lets them stare, stalk, and chase. But they can't pounce, grab, or kill bite their prey. You can imagine how frustrating that would be.

                        However, with a small addition to your laser play, you can make it a rewarding experience for your cat. Simply add in a toy that they can pounce, grab, and kill bite.
                        
                        As you're playing, have the laser occasionally land on a kicker toy or furry mouse so your cat can take out their predatory aggression on the toy. Then start moving the laser again. Or you can toss the mouse or kicker about every 20 seconds so your cat can chase it down for the pounce and kill bite.
                        
                        Watch your cat throughout this process. If they seem panicky or obsessive about the laser, and incorporating a stuffed toy for attacking does't help, they may not be well-suited for laser play. You want it to be fun, not stressful.</p>
