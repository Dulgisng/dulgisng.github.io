### All sections will be changed if there are any changes or better links that can be used to lead the user to better sites.

# BUGS

Unfortunently running the guides page through validator was giving and error for the center element as it was obsolete and was advised to use CSS instead.
This can be fixed given more time on the project by creating a css style for the images and links used in the page.
All other code has successfully been validated through W3C and Jigsaw.
